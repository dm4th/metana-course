* An owner account to change token balances on a whim (God Mod)
* The ability to elevate accounts to Authority Status (nearly God powers) or put accounts on a Sanction list
* EOAs can buy tokens at a ratio of 1K tokens / 1ETH
* EOAs can sell their tokens back to the contract at an exchange rate of 500 Tokens / 1 ETH
