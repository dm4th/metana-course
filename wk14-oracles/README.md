# Oracle Capstone Project

I used the chainlink oracles on ETH Mainnet to create a price comparison chart. Because of difficulties with the way round IDs are computed between contracts I specified historical data based on how many rounds you'd like to look back.

To view the project clone this directory and run 
### `npm start`
And a browser window should open shortly.

Changin inputs often requires a substantial amout of computation, so be patient!!!
